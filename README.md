# Smart India Hackathon 2023 – Citizen Service Chatbot (SIH2)

This repository contains the prototype developed by our team for **Smart India Hackathon 2023**.  
We advanced till **Round 3**, where we built a solution that simplifies **citizen access to public services** through an AI-powered chatbot and web interface.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Citizens often face difficulties in accessing government services due to:
- Lack of awareness of service availability.  
- Complicated procedures and fragmented portals.  
- Long waiting times and poor communication.  

**Challenge:** Design a digital solution that enables citizens to easily discover, access, and interact with public services in a seamless and user-friendly way.

## 💡 Our Solution
We proposed an **AI-powered Citizen Service Chatbot** integrated with a **multi-page web application**.  

Key features of our solution:
- **Chatbot Assistant** → Helps citizens get instant answers to queries.  
- **Service Discovery** → Lists government schemes and services in an easy-to-browse manner.  
- **Registration & Payment Pages** → Simple forms for user onboarding and transactions.  
- **Contact & Support Page** → Direct channel for user queries.  
- **UI/UX First Approach** → Designed clean, accessible layouts using Figma.  

This prototype demonstrates how **AI + Design Thinking** can improve public service delivery.
